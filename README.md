Decided to rework a previous coding project I added before (C# Beginner Guide Fighting Program) due to not adding the features that I wanted and honestly it wasn't a well coded/completed program from functions to the layout as well.
I've learned a bit more coding function wise with c# and wanted to rework the project from the ground up and use the old program as a reference to make a new and improved version of it.
How I will got about it this time is every change that I make in the project whether it be daily or just in general, I will post the date of when I worked on it along with what was added to the project so I can see the progress that was done on it so far.

How the rework fighting gamr begineer guide project will work:

The user will be asked if they are new to fighting games and would enter 1 for yes and 2 for no
If the user picks 2 for no, then the program would end
If the user picks 1 for yes then they would be to pick a fighting game between Street fighter 6, Tekken 8, and Mortal Kombat 1

Once the user picks one of the three fighting game options, they will be asked what they would like to learn about said fighting game
between movement, picking a character, or combos

Movements will explain how to move around in the game that they chose

Picking a character will display the list of available characters that are in the game currently (base roster and dlc characters)
and when they type the name of the character, it will display the difficulty the character is, a brief summary of the character, and ask what would they like to learn about the characters between key moves, combos, and strategy
if the pick key moves, it will display the common moves to use with the characters
if they pick combos, it will display 5 beginner friendly combos for the character that they picked
if they pick strategy, it will display the kind of playstyle the character is and how to be effective with them

Combos will display the combo structure of the following games that they picked and then would ask them if they would like to learn character specific combos and strategy for the character.

In regards of how it will functions for the three options between movement, picking a character, and combos it will be separated in three classes to make it easier to edit to informations and concepts
along with being able to call the class in the main function instead of putting it all in one big main function like I did in the previous fighting game project. I'm also using list,switch cases,while loops,and if else statements in the projects for a better structure.
